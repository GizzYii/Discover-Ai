### 🎬 Video Summary
The Black Box Problem refers to the lack of transparency in AI algorithms (especially Deep Learning models). The model takes complex inputs and produces an output, but the process remains hidden.

### 🔍 Definition and Origin
- **Black Box Problem:** AI algorithms take inputs and produce outputs, but it’s impossible to understand internally how they reach that output.  
- **Deep Learning:** Neural networks work with hundreds of layers and trillions of parameters, each contributing to the decision; tracking all interactions with human logic is impossible.  
- **Non-Linear Relationships:** Models learn complex relationships between data that cannot be expressed as simple “if-then” rules.

### ⚖️ Ethical and Practical Risks
- **Trust and Responsibility:** When a system makes a wrong decision, lack of explanation reduces trust and raises legal issues.  
- **Bias Detection:** If a model reflects biases in training data, it is difficult to detect and correct discriminatory decisions.  
- **Debugging:** Complex network structures make it almost impossible to trace the source of unexpected outputs.

### ✅ 2025 Status: Solutions (Explainable AI - XAI)
Although the Black Box Problem continues, Explainable AI (XAI) makes AI decisions more interpretable.  

| Method | What It Does | Example |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Feature Importance (SHAP/LIME)** | Shows which input features the model emphasizes | Real estate AI gives 70% weight to “school rating” and “square meters” |
| **Attention Maps** | Visualizes which parts of input the model focuses on | Facial recognition AI focuses only on the “eye area” and “nose” |
| **Post-Hoc Explanation** | Provides a human-understandable justification after the decision | AI flags a patient as high-risk and cites “low blood pressure and high cholesterol” |
